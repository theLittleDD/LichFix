As a lich player, I found that some of the core abilities / spells have bugs or have to be balanced. It shall allow you to have more fun.

- corrupted blood: 
1. now have save on cast / trigger
2. damage reduced (but progress with caster level)
3. adjustable range (5 feet is recommended)
4. metamagic selective now works on the corrupted blood trigger

- Lord beyond the grave:
1. work on LIVING companions and main character if the have the buff of Blessing of Unlife. (you may want to turn it off if you think it is too OP).

- Eye of the Bodak:
1. It will now show FX effect (same as the death gaze)
2. floating number will now shows when negative level is applied on enemies.

- Insightful Contemplation (Court Poet Skill):
1. As my Ember is a court poet, I found that something is going wrong if there is no FX effect when she play a song.
