  1. work on LIVING companions and main character if the have the buff of Blessing of Unlife. (you may want to turn it off if you think it is too OP).

- Eye of the Bodak:
  1. It will now show FX effect (same as the death gaze)
  2. floating number will now shows when negative level is applied on enemies.

- Insightful Contemplation (Court Poet Skill):
  1. As my Ember is a court poet, I found that something is going wrong if there is no FX effect when she play a song.
